//i)Write a program to print the area and perimeter of a triangle having sides of 3, 4 and 5
units by creating a class named 'Triangle' with  parameter length,bredth,height  in its constructor.

  def perimeter(): Int = {
    l + b + h

  }

  val b = 4
  val h = 5
  val triangle = new Triangle(l, b, h)
  val a = triangle.area()
  val p = triangle.perimeter()

  println(s"Area = $a square units")
