//
ii)Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and print
the final salary. 
1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as
parameter
2   -   'AddSal()'   which   adds   $10   to   salary   of   the   employee   if   it   is   less   than   $500.
3 - 'AddWork()' which adds $5 to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per
day is more than 6 hours


class Employee( var salary: Int, var workinghours: Int) {
  def addwork() = {
    if(workinghours>6)
      {
        salary +=5
      }
  }

  def addSalary() = {
    if(salary<500)
      {
        salary +=500
      }
  }

  def getInfo() = {
    println(s"initial salary  = $$$salary ")
    println(s"initial workinghours = $workinghours")

  }


}

object Main extends App {
var salary=10000
  var workinghours=10
  val emp = new Employee(salary,workinghours)
   emp.getInfo()
  emp.addSalary()
   emp.addwork()


  println(s"Perimeter = $$$salary units")
}
