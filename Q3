package com
case class StudentData(var email:String,var phoneNo: Long)
class Student(val studentName:String, val studentId:Int, var studentInfo:StudentData){
  var studentCourse:List[String]=List.empty
  def update(email:String,phone:Long): Unit = {
    studentInfo=StudentData(email, phone)
  }
  def enrollCourse(course:String): Unit = {
    studentCourse=course :: studentCourse
  }
  def removeCourse(course:String): Unit = {
    studentCourse=studentCourse.filter(_ !=course)
  }
  override def toString: String = {s"studentName : $studentName\nstudentId : $studentId\nstudentInfo : $studentInfo"}
}

  val student=new Student("babu", 12345, StudentData("ks@gmail.com",1234556778L))
